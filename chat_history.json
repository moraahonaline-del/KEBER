You want to build a mobile app for amber alerts in Kenya using React Native and Expo. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Alert Display:** A prominent home screen displaying active amber alerts in Kenya. Each alert should include essential information like the missing person's name, age, a photo (if available), and the location where they were last seen.\n-   **Push Notifications:** Implement push notifications to immediately notify users when a new amber alert is issued.\n-   **Information/Reporting:** A section where users can find more information about amber alerts, how they work in Kenya, and how to report a potential sighting.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray, for a clean and modern look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray, for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray, for less important information)\n    *   Primary: `#FF6F00` (Amber, reflecting the alert type)\n    *   Secondary: `#4CAF50` (Green, for positive actions like reporting a sighting)\n    *   Accent: `#03A9F4` (Light blue, for interactive elements)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White, for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFD54F` (Light amber, for emphasis)\n*   **Typography:** Use a clean, modern font like \"System\", \"Roboto\", or \"Open Sans\" for readability. Ensure text sizes are appropriate for mobile screens.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Home Screen (Alert Display):** Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to fetch and display amber alert data. Initially, this data can be mock data.\n2.  **Push Notifications:** Set up push notifications using Expo's push notification service. This will involve installing necessary packages and configuring the app to receive notifications.\n3.  **Information/Reporting:** Create a new screen or modal (potentially within the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` or a new route) to display information about amber alerts and provide a way for users to report sightings.\n4.  **Tab Bar:** Ensure the tab bar in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` includes relevant tabs for navigation (e.g., Home, Information/Report).\n\nNow, let's start by modifying the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to display mock amber alert data.\n\nAfter modifying the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-07T17:55:21.118048"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a mobile app for amber alerts in Kenya.

You want to add a feature to the app that allows users to take photos of potentially lost children and scan them against existing records. Here's a design vision and implementation plan:\n\n**Design Vision:**\n\nThe new feature will be implemented as a dedicated screen within the app, accessible from the tab bar. The screen will have a prominent button to activate the device's camera. After taking a photo, the app will display a confirmation screen, allowing the user to confirm or retake the picture. Once confirmed, the image will be processed and compared against existing records (this part would ideally use Supabase). The results of the scan will be displayed clearly, indicating potential matches or no matches found.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps involved:\n\n1.  **Create a new screen:** Create a new file, possibly named `app/(tabs)/scan.tsx`, to house the scanning functionality. Add a corresponding entry in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to include it in the tab navigation.\n2.  **Camera Integration:** Utilize `expo-camera` to access the device's camera. Implement a function to take a photo and store it temporarily.\n3.  **Image Confirmation:** Display the captured image with options to confirm or retake.\n4.  **Scanning Logic:** This is where Supabase would be needed. The image would be sent to Supabase, compared against existing records, and the results sent back to the app.\n5.  **Display Results:** Clearly present the scan results to the user, indicating potential matches or no matches found. If matches are found, display relevant information about the child.\n\nTo proceed, you'll need to enable Supabase by pressing the Supabase button and connecting to a project. This will allow you to store and compare the images of lost children.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-07T18:02:32.504340"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement a photo scanning feature for lost children.
