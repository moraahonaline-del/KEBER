[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I want to build a mobile app for amber alerts in Kenya"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand. You want to build a mobile app for amber alerts in Kenya using React Native and Expo. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Alert Display:** A prominent home screen displaying active amber alerts in Kenya. Each alert should include essential information like the missing person's name, age, a photo (if available), and the location where they were last seen.\n-   **Push Notifications:** Implement push notifications to immediately notify users when a new amber alert is issued.\n-   **Information/Reporting:** A section where users can find more information about amber alerts, how they work in Kenya, and how to report a potential sighting.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray, for a clean and modern look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray, for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray, for less important information)\n    *   Primary: `#FF6F00` (Amber, reflecting the alert type)\n    *   Secondary: `#4CAF50` (Green, for positive actions like reporting a sighting)\n    *   Accent: `#03A9F4` (Light blue, for interactive elements)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White, for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFD54F` (Light amber, for emphasis)\n*   **Typography:** Use a clean, modern font like \"System\", \"Roboto\", or \"Open Sans\" for readability. Ensure text sizes are appropriate for mobile screens.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Home Screen (Alert Display):** Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to fetch and display amber alert data. Initially, this data can be mock data.\n2.  **Push Notifications:** Set up push notifications using Expo's push notification service. This will involve installing necessary packages and configuring the app to receive notifications.\n3.  **Information/Reporting:** Create a new screen or modal (potentially within the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` or a new route) to display information about amber alerts and provide a way for users to report sightings.\n4.  **Tab Bar:** Ensure the tab bar in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` includes relevant tabs for navigation (e.g., Home, Information/Report).\n\nNow, let's start by modifying the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to display mock amber alert data.\n\nAfter modifying the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-07T17:55:21.118048"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a mobile app for amber alerts in Kenya.
